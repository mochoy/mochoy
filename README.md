## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
---

I'm a software engineering intern at Microsoft working on the brand new Surface Duo folding phone. Last year, I did a 9-month co-op at Apple as a hardware engineer on the Apple TV. From San Francisco, CA. Junior (?) at Cal Poly SLO studying electrical engineering. 

### ðŸ”­ Cool Projects
---

[Suild.com](http://suild.com/): Website to sell PCB-based electronics products for Nerf blasters, offer technical documentation, and host interactive web applications. 30,000+ annual sessions, MERN stack.

[Montychoy.com](http://montychoy.com/): My personal website. Check out that dope home image. I update it every year for intership application season. 

[Select-Fire Rapidstrike Kit](https://suild.com/shop/4): PCB-based product to enable select-fire control in a Nerf blaster. Features ATmega328P MCU & PID controlled inductive load powered by a high-discharge LiPo battery. 300+ sold to 10+ countries. 

[Flywheel Setup Picker](https://suild.com/tools/flywheel-setup-picker): Basically Reddit for motorized Nerf blasters.

### ðŸ¤” Random Interests
---

#### ðŸ’» Computer organization/SoC platform architecture: 
- Just reading up. Doing stuff is super complicated.
- After modeling microarchitecture + ISA + MCU to implement RISC-V ISA, I don't really like HDL/RTL stuff, but I'm still super interested in how everything works. 
- Worked with Apple A-core SoCs and Qualcomm Snapdragon platform on Surface Duo. 

As my mentor said: 
> That shit is super complicated man

#### âš¡ Buck converters:
- Designing my own buck converter. Starting with just simulations to analyze ideal open-loop steady-state behavior. 
- Haven't taken signals & systems class, don't know jack about controls (if you're an interviewer reading this, ask me about literally anything else).
- Plan on designing buck converter PCB. Will use IC to handle controls, but everything else (FETs, caps, inductor, feedback network) will be discretes. 
- DC-DC lead on a project at Apple, worked on Apple's custom PMUs and multiphase bucks.

Me (freshman after being asked this in an interview):
> What's stability in a buck converter? 

Taufik (power electronics professor):
> HAHAHA I can't tell you until you're in third year
